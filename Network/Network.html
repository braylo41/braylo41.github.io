<p>Interactive network graph of common illnesses and their associated symptoms</p>
<div id="Network"></div>
<p>This visualization is interactive. Hover over the nodes to see their associated attributes. The Linkpath took a long time to get working, at first it would only work for some of the Illness nodes of which they would only show one relationship. It finally worked after I flattened the data set.
    Words of wisdom, vega does not like to compare arrays.</p>
<p>I created this dataset, it can be found in the Network.json file on my GitHub.</p>
<script>
    const Network = "Network.json";
    Network.valueOf()
    vegaEmbed("#Network", Network)
        .then(result => console.log(result))
        .catch(console.warn);
